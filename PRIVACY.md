# Privacy Policy for Rakat Counter

**Last Updated: January 3, 2026**

Rakat Counter ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The App is designed with a "Local-First" philosophy. Our goal is to provide a zero-distraction experience without compromising your privacy.

### Microphone Access
The App requests permission to access your device's microphone. This is used **strictly locally** to monitor ambient sound levels (audio metering). The App uses this data to detect the physical "thump" of a prostration on a prayer mat. 
- **No audio is recorded, saved, or transmitted.**
- **No voice data is processed.**
- The raw audio stream is processed in real-time on your device and discarded immediately.

### Motion Data
The App uses your device's accelerometer to track movement and vibrations. This data is processed locally to increment the prayer count.
- **No motion data is saved or transmitted.**

## 2. Data Storage
Special attention has been paid to ensure that **zero data** leaves your device.
- All Rakat counts are stored locally in your device's secure storage.
- There is no central server, no cloud synchronization, and no user accounts.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The App does not share any data with third-party services. There are no analytics, no advertisements, and no trackers in the App.

## 4. Children’s Privacy
The App does not collect any personal information. It is safe for use by individuals of all ages.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
